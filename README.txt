MediaSharp - Nothing more than a weighted average calculator
============================================================

The title says it all: it just calculates the weighted average,
useful for lazy students (like me) that don't want to use the
"manual" calculators everytime.

It allows saving and opening files. 

Files are nothing more than XML structures.

Source code is poorly commented because it is a so simple software
with a so simple usage and UI that everyone should be able to
understand it.

Enjoy.
